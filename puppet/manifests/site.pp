# In the default deployment case, we want to run an 'apt-get dist-upgrade'
# to ensure the latest packages are installed. This is done by including the
# class 'site_config::slow' here. However, you only changed a small bit of
# the platform and want to skip this slow part of deployment, you can do that
# by using 'leap deploy --fast' which will only apply those resources that are
# tagged with 'leap_base' or 'leap_service'.
# See https://leap.se/en/docs/platform/details/under-the-hood#tags
